# Neural-Networks
Implementing basics of Deep Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network by tuning parameters such as epoch, loss, optimizer, early stopping and experimenting with a number of Conv2D layers and their neurons. 
The datasets used are:
1. MNIST
2. Fashion MNIST
3. Horses vs Humans
